     * would then start writing, hit ENOSPC, throw {@code FSWriteError}, and under the shipped
     * {@code disk_failure_policy: stop} take the node out of the ring. With
     * {@code partialCompactionsAcceptable() == false} the pre-flight runs, {@code reduceScopeForLimitedSpace}
     * refuses to shrink the freeze, and the task aborts cleanly with "Not enough space for compaction"
     * before writing a byte - the same choice {@link LeveledCompactionTask} and {@link SSTableSplitter} make.

     * ({@code TimeSeriesCompactionStrategy#recordCompletedRewrite}). No event fires for a split output,
     * because no single sstable represents the window.
     * <p>
     * The guard callback fires here for the same reason the listeners do, and unconditionally: a freeze
     * that emitted two sstables, or none, is still a freeze that ran, and "ran and changed nothing" is
     * exactly what the guard has to count.
