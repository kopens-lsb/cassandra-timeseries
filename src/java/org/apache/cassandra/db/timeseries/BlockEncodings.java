/**
 * The chunk-format-v4 §5 block encodings: the exact size of every candidate for one block, the
 * deterministic choice between them, and the encode/decode of the ones that do not need ALP.
 *
 * <p>A block <em>payload</em> is what follows the block's presence bytes inside its body; §4.5 puts
 * the two together and {@link ChunkV4Section} is where that composition lives. The payloads:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   0x01 EMPTY            0 B                       -- only when the block has no present value
 *   0x02 CONSTANT         0 B when statWidth &gt; 0     -- the value is the block table's min
 *                         varint len + bytes, pad 8 -- when statWidth == 0 there is no min to hold it
 *   0x03 PRESENCE_ONLY    0 B                       -- the value is the column's constant (directory)
 *   0x10 FOR_BITPACK      width u8 | pad 7 | lane(n, width) | [exception area]
 *   0x11 DELTA_FOR_BITPACK firstValue i64 | deltaBase i64 | width u8 | pad 7 |
 *                          lane(n-1, width) | [exception area]
 *   0x20 ALP / 0x21 ALP_RD                          -- routed to the {@link DoubleBlockCodec} seam
 *   0x30 BITPACK1         lane(n, 1)                -- boolean
 *   0x40 DICT             lane(n, ceil(log2(dictCount)))
 *   0x41 RAW              n x (canonical varint len + bytes), pad 8
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>{@code n} is the present count, never the row count.</b> Every lane length here is
 * {@code ceil(n*width/64)*8} where {@code n} is the popcount of the block's presence words (§5, §6).
 * A block that is 1,024 rows and 3 present values has a three-value lane; using the row count would
 * not merely waste bytes, it would put every value at the wrong lane index and return other rows'
 * data without throwing.
 *
 * <p><b>The code points are {@link ChunkV4BlockTable}'s, not restated here.</b> Two definitions of
 * an encoding code is how a format acquires two layouts for one code, and the block table is where
 * the byte is written.
 *
 * <p><b>The choice among encodings is an argmin over an exact closed-form size, ties broken by the
 * lowest code point.</b> That is §5 rule 3, a determinism rule and not a preference: nothing here
 * trial-encodes, times, samples or consults a threshold. A replica that broke a tie the other way
 * would emit a byte-different chunk, {@code chunkUnchanged} would report a difference, and every
 * chunk would be rewritten every cycle -- which looks like a capacity problem, not like a codec bug
 * (§12). The candidates are evaluated in ascending code order and the incumbent is only displaced
 * by a strictly smaller size, so "first to reach the minimum keeps it" is exactly "lowest code
 * wins"; never relax that comparison to {@code <=}.
 *
 * <p>Two consequences of the tie rule are worth naming because they look like omissions:
 * {@code PRESENCE_ONLY} is unreachable on a column with a block-table min, since {@code CONSTANT} is
 * also 0 bytes there and has the lower code; and {@code DICT} beats {@code RAW} whenever they cost
 * the same. Both are stable, both are pinned by tests.
 *
 * <p><b>Values arrive in the column's arithmetic domain</b>: sign-extended for {@code INT32},
 * zero-extended for {@code DATE32} (unsigned days), the raw {@code doubleToRawLongBits} pattern for
 * {@code DOUBLE}, 0 or 1 for {@code BOOLEAN}. That is what makes {@code v - min} a non-negative
 * frame-of-reference residual for the types {@code FOR_BITPACK} accepts. It is deliberately
 * <em>not</em> the "raw bits, zero-extended" convention the block table uses for its extrema, so
 * {@link #toStatBits} and {@link #fromStatBits} convert at that boundary and nowhere else.
 *
 * <p>{@code FOR_BITPACK} takes its minimum from the block table entry rather than repeating it in
 * the body -- which is why its header is one width byte -- and that is only sound while the column's
 * {@link StatOrder} is the same order the subtraction assumes. It is therefore offered for
 * {@code INT32}, {@code INT64} and {@code DATE32} and never for {@code DOUBLE}: a double column's
 * extrema are ordered by {@code Double.compare} (§4), and the raw bits of a negative double ascend
 * as the value descends, so {@code rawBits(v) - rawBits(min)} is not a residual at all. Doubles are
 * ALP's or they are {@code RAW}.
 *
 * <p><b>The ALP seam.</b> {@code 0x20} and {@code 0x21} are declared, routed and never produced by
 * this layer; {@link DoubleBlockCodec} is the interface the later phase implements over the existing
 * {@code AlpCodec}. What it must supply is on that interface, and one requirement is worth repeating
 * here because it is not local to it: the codec must be a build-time constant, identical on every
 * node. A codec that is present on some replicas and absent on others is a byte-determinism break of
 * exactly the shape §12 calls the format's largest risk.
 *
 * <p>Corruption is {@link IllegalArgumentException} (§11), including an ALP code arriving while no
 * codec is installed -- no encoder in this build can emit one, so inside a v4 payload it is a
 * flipped bit. The scalar decode path allocates nothing per value: lanes unpack into a
 * caller-supplied {@code long[]}, width choice reuses a caller-supplied histogram, and the exception
 * buffers live in a caller-supplied {@link Scratch}.

     * strictfp discipline; the work is a body layout that obeys §5 and §6 and an adapter to this
     * interface.
     *
     * <p>The contract, in the order it will bite:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link #payloadLength} must be an <b>exact closed form</b> computed from a parameter
     *     search, not a trial encode. §5 rule 3 forbids encode-and-compare, and the argmin here
     *     calls it before any bytes exist.</li>
     * <li>The parameter search must be reproducible: {@code strictfp}, a table of exact powers of
     *     ten rather than {@code Math.pow}, and a <b>specified</b> tie-break over {@code (e, f)}
     *     candidates. §12 names the unspecified tie-break as a concrete risk.</li>
     * <li>Sampling is permitted only if the sampling rule is specified and input-determined -- the
     *     reference implementation's speed comes from sampling, and §12 explicitly prefers a pinned
     *     sampling rule to a relaxed determinism rule.</li>
     * <li>Every payload must be a multiple of 8 bytes and every pad byte 0x00, verified on decode
     *     (§5 rule 5, §6).</li>
     * <li>Exceptions go in the shared {@link ExceptionArea}, {@code W} 8 for ALP and
     *     {@link ExceptionArea#VALUE_BYTES_ALP_RD_LEFT} for ALP-RD's left parts, and
     *     {@code blockFlags} bit 4 must agree with whether one was written.</li>
     * <li>NaN payloads, -0.0, subnormals and the infinities must survive bit-exactly; a port that
     *     normalises NaN passes a round-trip test on ordinary data and corrupts a real column.</li>
