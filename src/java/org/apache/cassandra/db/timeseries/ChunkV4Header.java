/**
 * The forty-byte chunk-format-v4 header (§3), and the single place the §2 row-to-block arithmetic
 * lives.
 *
 * <p><b>Offsets 0, 1, 5 and 13 are byte-for-byte the version-3 header's</b>: {@code version} u8,
 * {@code rowCount} u32, {@code firstTimestamp} i64, {@code lastTimestamp} i64. That is not
 * nostalgia, it is the whole of §3's stated requirement -- {@link #rowCount(ByteBuffer)},
 * {@link #firstTimestamp(ByteBuffer)} and {@link #lastTimestamp(ByteBuffer)} stay constant-time
 * peeks that read one field out of the first 21 bytes and <b>never parse the directory, a block
 * table or a section</b>. Tiering asks every chunk for its time bounds to decide whether to open it
 * at all, so a peek that had to decode anything would make "skip this chunk" cost as much as
 * reading it. Keep those four offsets where they are; a field inserted ahead of them is not a
 * layout change, it is a performance regression in the one path that runs on chunks nobody wants.
 *
 * <p>The rest of the header is the v4 delta (§0): a u32 {@code directoryLen} in place of v3's u16
 * ({@code dirSize} could not address the 4 GiB directory §7 permits -- an unreachable contradiction
 * v4 removes), an explicit {@code directoryOffset} so the constant is stated rather than assumed,
 * the timestamp axis promoted to a section with its own offset and length, and {@code blockSizeLog2}
 * so a reader never has to guess the block geometry it is about to index with.
 *
 * <p>§3 records what was deliberately left out and why, and those decisions are load-bearing here:
 * no magic number (the version byte already dispatches), no CRC32C (SSTable compression already
 * checksums, so this class detects structural corruption -- an impossible length, a misaligned
 * offset -- and does not pretend to detect a flipped bit inside a timestamp), no total length
 * ({@code payload.remaining()} is authoritative and is what every bound below is checked against),
 * and no chunk flags byte.
 *
 * <p><b>Validation is total on {@link #read} and on construction.</b> The constructor checks
 * everything expressible without the payload, {@link #read} adds the payload bounds, and the two
 * together mean the encoder cannot build a header the decoder would reject. Nothing in this class
 * allocates from a length read out of the payload -- the header is fixed-size and its fields are
 * only ever compared against {@code payload.remaining()} -- so a corrupt length here throws and
 * cannot reserve memory.
