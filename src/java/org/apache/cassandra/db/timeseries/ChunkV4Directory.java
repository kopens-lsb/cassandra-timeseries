/**
 * The chunk-format-v4 column directory (§4): one entry per column, sorted by column name in natural
 * {@code String} order, the region padded to a multiple of 8.
 *
 * <p>Entry layout, exactly §4:
 * {@code typeCode u8 | colFlags u8 | statOrder u8 | nameLen u8 | name | sectionOffset u32 |
 * sectionLen u32 | blockCount u32 | [constLen varint + constBytes] | [min, max]}.
 *
 * <p><b>What the directory buys, and therefore what it must never lose.</b> §0 keeps three v3
 * properties here and strengthens one. The type code still selects <em>compression only</em>, never
 * meaning. {@code CONSTANT} and {@code ALL_NULL} columns are still O(1) bytes -- in the production
 * shape four of eight columns are zero-byte sections, which is the single largest win in the format
 * and is why {@code sectionLen == 0} is a checked invariant here rather than an emergent property.
 * An unprojected column is still skipped, and now skipped by jumping: {@code sectionOffset} is
 * explicit, so a reader never has to walk a prefix sum over sections it does not want.
 *
 * <p><b>Every cross-field rule §4 states is enforced on both sides.</b> The {@link Entry}
 * constructor is where they live, so an entry that could not be read cannot be built either, and
 * the encoder finds out at the moment it constructs a bad entry rather than at the moment a replica
 * fails to decode one:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>type code {@code 0x00} is a permanent zero trap and every code outside {@code 0x01..0x07} is
 *     corruption (§11) -- an unknown-but-plausible code inside a v4 payload is a flipped bit, since
 *     a genuinely new format would carry a different version byte;</li>
 * <li>{@code colFlags & 0xF0} must be zero, and the flag combinations that describe nothing --
 *     {@code ALL_NULL} together with {@code ALL_PRESENT} or with {@code CONSTANT} -- are rejected;</li>
 * <li>{@code sectionLen == 0} exactly when the column is {@code ALL_NULL} or an all-present
 *     {@code CONSTANT} (§2), and {@code blockCount == 0} exactly then too;</li>
 * <li>{@code CONSTANT} and {@code ALL_NULL} columns carry no statistics;</li>
 * <li>a column whose type code is {@code OPAQUE} carries {@code statOrder = NONE};</li>
 * <li>statistics exist exactly when {@code statOrder != NONE}, so an unusable extremum can never be
 *     stored (§5 rule 6: unused fields are zero, and a stat under no order is unusable);</li>
 * <li>{@code min} does not exceed {@code max} under the declared order.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The {@code OPAQUE} rule is stricter than it looks, deliberately.</b> §4 forces
 * {@code statOrder = NONE} on a column <em>downgraded</em> to {@code OPAQUE} because one
 * width-incompatible value made its fixed-width encoding impossible -- §12 ranks the interaction
 * fourth on its risk list, a one-line rule that is easy to forget and that only a corpus containing
 * a zero-length fixed-width value will catch. A decoder cannot tell a downgraded column from a
 * column that was a {@code blob} all along, so the rule is applied to every {@code OPAQUE} column:
 * in v4.0 a native {@code blob} column carries no statistics either. That costs pruning on blob
 * columns and buys an invariant that is checkable from the bytes alone; a v5 that wants blob stats
 * back should spend a distinct type code on it rather than a convention the reader cannot verify.
 *
 * <p><b>Statistics are omitted, never truncated</b> (§7: 256 bytes). The reason is not size, it is
 * that a truncated maximum is not an upper bound. Chop {@code "zzz...z"} to 256 bytes and the
 * result compares <em>below</em> the value it was meant to bound, so a reader that trusts it skips
 * a block that does contain matching rows -- a missing row, not a slow query. A truncated minimum
 * fails symmetrically. There is no cheap way to round a truncated string outward that survives
 * every order in {@link StatOrder}, so an over-long extremum means no statistics for that column at
 * all, and that is always sound. Do not "optimise" this into a truncation.
 *
 * <p><b>Byte determinism</b> (§5): entries are emitted in natural {@code String} order and the
 * order is verified on read, every numeric field is fixed width, the two length fields that §4
 * spells as varints are canonical minimal ones ({@link BlockPresence}'s helpers, which reject a
 * non-minimal encoding), and the pad to 8 is zero-filled and verified. {@code directoryLen} must
 * equal the padded length of what was actually parsed, so a directory cannot be trailed by extra
 * zero bytes that would give one directory two encodings.
 *
 * <p>Every allocation is bounded before it is made: a name is at most 255 bytes by construction of
 * its {@code u8} length, an extremum at most 256 by §7, and a constant's length is checked against
 * the bytes remaining <em>in the directory region</em> before the array is created. A corrupt
 * length throws; it cannot reserve memory.
