/**
 * One column section's block table (chunk-format-v4 §5): a fixed-width entry per block, uniform
 * across the section, carrying the block's extrema, where its body starts, how it is encoded, and
 * its presence mode.
 *
 * <p>Entry width follows the column's {@code statWidth} (§5, and {@link ChunkV4Directory#statWidth}
 * derives it from the type code):
 *
 * <pre>
 *   statWidth 8  (DOUBLE, INT64, timestamp axis)  24 B  min(8) max(8) bodyOffset(4) enc(1) flags(1) pad(2)
 *   statWidth 4  (INT32, DATE32)                  16 B  min(4) max(4) bodyOffset(4) enc(1) flags(1) pad(2)
 *   statWidth 0  (BOOLEAN, TEXT, OPAQUE)           8 B                bodyOffset(4) enc(1) flags(1) pad(2)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Body length is derived, never stored:</b> block {@code k} occupies
 * {@code entry[k+1].bodyOffset - entry[k].bodyOffset}, and the last block occupies
 * {@code sectionLen - entry[last].bodyOffset}. That is not a byte-saving trick, it is what makes
 * every body bounds-checkable. A stored length can disagree with the next block's offset, and a
 * decoder that trusted it would read past its block into the next one and return the wrong values
 * without throwing. Derived lengths cannot disagree with anything, provided the offsets are
 * verified monotonic and inside the section -- which is the whole of this class's validation
 * burden, and is done in one place, once, on read and on write alike.
 *
 * <p><b>Offsets are section-relative.</b> The derivation above subtracts from {@code sectionLen},
 * which is a section-relative quantity, so {@code bodyOffset} must be measured from the section's
 * first byte and not from the payload's. The table itself lives inside the section (after the
 * preamble §2 allows for text and opaque dictionaries), so {@code tableOffset} is passed in and the
 * first body offset is checked against the end of the table -- a body that started inside the table
 * that described it would be self-overlapping in a way no bounds check on {@code sectionLen} alone
 * would catch.
 *
 * <p><b>Everything here is a multiple of 8 and stays that way for free</b> (§6): all three entry
 * sizes are, so the table's length is; every {@code bodyOffset} and {@code sectionLen} is checked
 * to be, so every derived body length is. That is what lets an unpack kernel read a body as whole
 * {@code getLong}s with no epilogue.
 *
 * <p><b>Corruption</b> (§11, §5): an unknown {@code blockEncoding} -- including {@code 0x00}, which
 * no code is assigned -- is a flipped bit and not a future format, because a future format would
 * carry a different version byte. §9 does allow new encoding codes without a version bump; that is
 * a statement about how the format may grow, not a licence for this build to guess at a code it
 * cannot decode. Reserved {@code blockFlags} bits 5-7 must be zero, the two pad bytes must be zero
 * and are verified (§5 rule 5), and every stat field a block does not use must be zero (§5 rule 6),
 * which is checked for {@code statWidth 0} entries, for all-null blocks, and for the boolean flags
 * on a column that has numeric extrema. The reward for the pad check is out of proportion to its
 * cost: a zeroed or half-written region cannot parse at all, because encoding {@code 0x00} is
 * invalid, so an all-zero entry is rejected on its first byte.
 *
 * <p><b>What this class deliberately does not check:</b> that {@code min <= max}. The extrema are
 * raw fixed-width bits and their order is the column's {@link StatOrder}, which lives in the
 * directory entry, not here -- the same separation that makes pruning sound (§4). The section
 * encoder holds both and must do it there.
 *
 * <p>Allocation is bounded by {@code blockCount}, which the caller takes from the directory, where
 * it is already checked against the §2 derivation from the header. Nothing here sizes an array from
 * a length read out of the payload.
