/**
 * Merges rows decoded from the {@code __chunks} shadow table into a read's <b>unfiltered</b>
 * partition iterator, i.e. while range tombstones, row deletions and cell tombstones are still in
 * the stream.
 * <p>
 * The timing is the whole point. The synthetic chunk rows go to
 * {@link UnfilteredRowIterators#merge(List)} as just another source, so Cassandra's ordinary
 * reconciliation decides what survives -- a partition deletion, a range tombstone covering the
 * sample's clustering, a row deletion or a newer cell tombstone all shadow the reconstructed data
 * exactly as they would shadow a real base row. Merging after {@code Filter} has run (what SP3
 * originally did) cannot honour a delete at all: {@code Filter} purges every tombstone and drops
 * every row left empty, so the merge would be handed a stream with no deletion information in it.
 * <p>
 * This works only because the reconstruction post-dates the re-encoder's own delete: see
 * {@link ChunkReadSupport}, which stamps every synthetic row at {@code max_row_writetime + 1}. At
 * {@code max_row_writetime} the tiering tombstone -- issued at exactly that timestamp -- would
 * shadow everything this class produces.
 * <p>
 * Partitions the hot iterator does not contain at all (fully chunked tags) are synthesized in the
 * position given by {@code expectedKeys}, which must list the query's partition keys in the same
 * order the hot iterator yields them (the read command/group order).
 * <p>
 * <b>The chunk side is pulled, not handed over.</b> {@code chunkRows} yields a
 * {@link CloseableIterator}, not a list, so a window is fetched and decoded only when the merge
 * actually reaches it: a {@code LIMIT} satisfied from the newest window leaves every older one
 * untouched, which is the difference between a tiered unbounded read costing one window and costing
 * the whole retention period ({@link ChunkRowSource}). The corollary is that this class now owns a
 * closeable per partition it is working on, and every path out -- merged, synthesized, empty, or
 * thrown -- has to release it.
 * <p>
 * <b>That ordering is an enforced invariant, not an assumption.</b> If the hot iterator ever yields a
 * key {@code expectedKeys} has already passed -- which is one wiring change away, since
 * {@code SinglePartitionReadQuery.Group#executeLocally} sorts by <em>token</em> while {@code queries}
 * is sorted by partition-key <em>value</em> -- the old "synthesize and carry on" handling emitted that
 * partition <b>twice</b>: once chunk-only, once merged. Two partitions with the same key in one result
 * is silent duplication that no downstream stage rejects, so a divergence fails the query instead (see
 * {@link #outOfOrder}).
