/**
 * SP3 transparent reads (design spec section 3.3.1): decides whether a SELECT on a tiering-enabled
 * table must merge in decoded chunk rows, fetches and decodes the relevant chunks at the user's
 * consistency level, and wraps the hot {@link UnfilteredPartitionIterator} with the merge decorator.
 *
 * Activation requires ALL of: a single-partition (or IN) read group; a slice or names clustering
 * filter; a chunk table that exists; and a requested time range reaching below the point where cold
 * data can start. Everything else returns the hot iterator untouched - the non-tiered fast path pays
 * nothing beyond one schema-extension lookup and one cached {@link ChunkCoverage} lookup.
 *
 * <b>The merge gate is real coverage, not the current policy.</b> The only sound question is "do
 * chunks exist at or below this query's timestamps?", answered by {@link ChunkCoverage}; asking the
 * live {@link TieringPolicy} instead lets three ordinary tuning actions -- raising {@code hot_window},
 * dropping the extension, shrinking {@code chunk_window} -- silently hide history whose base rows
 * were deleted when it was encoded. The policy still contributes a floor
 * ({@code max(coverageTop, hotBoundary)}): anything the re-encoder has just written is by definition
 * below the current hot boundary, so a node whose cached coverage is a minute stale still merges it.
 *
 * <b>The wrap happens on the UNFILTERED stream</b>, before {@code Filter} purges tombstones, so
 * deletes are reconciled by the ordinary read machinery instead of being invisible to the merge --
 * see {@link ChunkMergeUnfilteredIterator}. Every unfiltered-to-filtered conversion point on a
 * single-partition read path therefore calls {@link #maybeWrap}: the local ones
 * ({@code SinglePartitionReadQuery.Group#executeInternal}, {@code AbstractReadQuery#executeInternal})
 * and the coordinator ones -- {@code DigestResolver#getData}, which serves a read whose digests
 * agreed, and {@code DataResolver#resolveInternal}, which is the single point every reconciling path
 * funnels through: the digest-<em>mismatch</em> retry ({@code AbstractReadRepair#startRepair} ->
 * {@code DataResolver#resolve}), the transient-replica branch of {@code DigestResolver#getData},
 * short-read protection and replica filtering protection.
 *
 * <p><b>Where in {@code resolveInternal} is load-bearing.</b> The wrap goes on the output of
 * {@code UnfilteredPartitionIterators.merge(results, mergeListener)}, i.e. strictly after read
 * repair's merge listener has been attached to the replica sources. A synthetic chunk row reaching
 * that listener would look like a row present in the merged result and absent from every replica, so
 * read repair would write it back into the base table as a real row -- undoing the compression and
 * resurrecting data the re-encoder deliberately deleted. {@code TieredStorageDistributedTest#
 * digestMismatchStillMergesChunksWithoutRepairingThemBack} holds both halves of that in place.
