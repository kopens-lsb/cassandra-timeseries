/**
 * ALP -- Adaptive Lossless floating-Point (Afroozeh, Kuffo, Boncz, SIGMOD 2024) -- the planning and
 * value math behind the chunk format's only double encodings, v4's {@code 0x20 ALP} and
 * {@code 0x21 ALP_RD} blocks. {@link AlpBlockCodec} owns the v4 byte layout and calls in here for
 * every decision that two replicas must make identically; this class's own v3 container framing
 * (sub-format byte, LEB128 varints, gap-coded exceptions, MSB-first bitstream) was deleted with the
 * rest of the v3 read/write path.
 *
 * <p><b>Two variants.</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><i>Decimal</i> ALP. Most doubles produced by measurement are decimals of few digits
 *       ({@code 20.76}, {@code 157.0}). Each is re-expressed as the integer
 *       {@code i = round(v * 10^e * 10^-f)}, which decodes back as {@code i * 10^f * 10^-e}; the
 *       integers are frame-of-reference'd against the block minimum and bit-packed at the width the
 *       block needs. Any value that does not survive that round trip <em>bit for bit</em> is an
 *       exception, stored verbatim as its 64-bit pattern next to its row position.</li>
 *   <li>ALP <i>Real Double</i>, for values that are not decimal-like. Each 64-bit pattern is cut
 *       into a {@code leftBitWidth}-bit high part and a {@code 64 - leftBitWidth}-bit low part. The
 *       high parts of a real column take few distinct values (same sign, same or adjacent binades),
 *       so they are dictionary-coded; the low part is stored verbatim. Rows whose high part missed
 *       the dictionary carry it explicitly.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Losslessness is structural, not statistical.</b> Neither variant can lose a bit:
 * decimal ALP verifies every value against {@code Double.doubleToRawLongBits} and demotes any
 * mismatch to a verbatim exception, and ALP-RD reassembles {@code (left << rightBitWidth) | right}
 * from parts that were both stored exactly. {@code -0.0}, every NaN payload (quiet and signalling),
 * the infinities, subnormals, {@code MIN_VALUE} and {@code MAX_VALUE} therefore all survive; the
 * decimal path simply refuses them and pays 8 bytes each, and ALP-RD never even inspects them as
 * numbers. Nothing here converts a {@code long} bit pattern to a {@code double} and back as a way of
 * carrying it: the value pipeline is {@code long} raw bits end to end, and the {@code double} view
 * exists only inside the decimal arithmetic, whose result is checked against the original bits.
 *
 * <p><b>Determinism.</b> Two replicas encoding the same window must produce byte-identical payloads
 * -- {@code TieredStorageService.chunkUnchanged} compares payload bytes -- so every choice made
 * here is a pure function of the input array:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The {@code (e, f)} search samples with a <b>fixed integer stride</b> (never an RNG), scores
 *       all {@code 0 <= f <= e <= 18} pairs, and keeps the best {@link #CANDIDATE_LIMIT} under the
 *       strict total order (estimated bits asc, {@code e} asc, {@code f} asc). Those candidates are
 *       then measured exactly over the whole block by the caller.</li>
 *   <li>The ALP-RD dictionary is the top {@link #RD_MAX_DICTIONARY} high parts under (frequency
 *       desc, value asc) -- a total order over a histogram held in an <b>array</b>, never a
 *       {@code HashMap} whose iteration order is unspecified.</li>
 *   <li>The only floating-point operations are {@code *} and {@link Math#rint}. Java multiplication
 *       is IEEE-754 correctly rounded and (since Java 17) unconditionally strict -- no x87 extended
 *       precision, and Java never contracts {@code a*b+c} into an FMA -- while {@code Math.rint}'s
 *       specification admits exactly one result for every input, with no ulp allowance of the kind
 *       {@code Math.sin}/{@code pow} carry. Both are therefore reproducible across JVMs and CPUs.
 *       <b>Any future use of a transcendental, of {@code Math.round}'s half-up rule, or of
 *       {@code strictfp}-sensitive code here must be treated as a determinism regression.</b></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The class is declared {@code strictfp} even though, from Java 17, that is redundant.</b>
 * chunk-format-v4 §5 rule 8 names {@code strictfp} on ALP as a rule and §12 names a non-strict
 * baseline as a concrete risk; the modifier costs nothing, and it is the only thing that keeps the
 * guarantee true if this arithmetic is ever moved to a class or a baseline where it is not free.
 * The value math -- {@link #tryEncode} and {@link #decodeOne} -- lives here and nowhere else, so
 * this is the class the modifier has to be on.
