/**
 * The chunk-format-v4 §5 shared exception area: a sorted list of {@code (position, verbatim value)}
 * pairs that sits after a packed lane and rescues the handful of values that would otherwise have
 * forced the whole lane wider.
 *
 * <p>Layout, exactly §5: {@code excCount u16 | pad u16 | pad u32} then {@code excCount} entries of
 * {@code position u16, value W bytes}, positions strictly ascending, the whole area padded to a
 * multiple of 8 (§6). {@code W} is 8 for {@code DOUBLE}/{@code INT64}, 4 for {@code INT32}/
 * {@code DATE32}, and 2 for the ALP-RD left parts a later phase will store here.
 *
 * <p><b>Making this a shared facility rather than an ALP-internal detail is the decision that pays
 * for itself twice</b> (§5). It gives integer columns outlier tolerance: one value of 2^31 in an
 * otherwise 10-bit block costs a 10-byte entry instead of widening 1,024 values from 10 bits to 31,
 * which is 8 bytes against 2,688. And it gives the timestamp axis gap tolerance -- a single missed
 * sample no longer widens every delta in the block -- which is what let §0 delete the
 * delta-of-delta bitstream outright and make timestamps an ordinary block-shaped {@code INT64}-like
 * column. A per-codec exception mechanism would have bought the first of those and none of the
 * second.
 *
 * <p><b>The lane value at an exception position must be zero, and the decoder verifies it.</b> This
 * is §5 rule 6's "specified filler" and the reason is byte determinism, not tidiness: the lane slot
 * is dead -- whatever it holds is discarded and replaced by the exception's verbatim value -- so
 * without a specified value an encoder is free to leave the truncated residual, or a stale scratch
 * byte, or zero, and three encoders produce three different chunks from one input.
 * {@code chunkUnchanged} then reports a difference forever and every chunk is rewritten every cycle,
 * a failure that presents as a capacity problem rather than as a codec bug (§12). Zero is cheap to
 * write, cheap to assert, and the check costs one array read per exception.
 *
 * <p><b>A position is an index into the lane this area accompanies</b>, not a row offset and not a
 * value index in some other domain. What a lane slot means is the encoding's business:
 * {@code FOR_BITPACK}'s slot {@code i} feeds present value {@code i}, {@code DELTA_FOR_BITPACK}'s
 * slot {@code j} feeds present value {@code j + 1}. This class only requires that positions are
 * distinct, ascending, and inside the lane the caller declares -- which is exactly what makes the
 * area decodable in one forward pass with no seek and no sort.
 *
 * <p><b>Strictly ascending is one check doing two jobs.</b> §5 requires ascending order (so a
 * decoder can merge the area into the lane in one pass) and distinct positions (so one lane slot
 * cannot be given two values). {@code position <= previous} rejects both, and it also removes the
 * second byte form a set of exceptions would otherwise have -- any permutation of the same pairs
 * would decode identically and re-encode differently.
 *
 * <p>Values are stored and returned as the low {@code 8*W} bits of the verbatim value, zero-extended
 * into a {@code long} -- the same "raw bits, not numbers" convention {@link ChunkV4BlockTable.Entry}
 * uses for its extrema, and for the same reason: whether those bits mean a signed {@code int}, an
 * unsigned day count or the bit pattern of a {@code double} is the column's business, and a layer
 * that sign-extended on the way in would write one value as two different byte sequences.
 *
 * <p>Corruption is {@link IllegalArgumentException} (§11). Nothing here allocates: the position and
 * value arrays are caller-supplied and caller-sized, {@code excCount} is bounded against the lane
 * length the caller derived from the header before it is used for anything, and the entry region is
 * bounds-checked against the buffer before the first entry is read. A corrupt {@code excCount} can
 * make this throw; it cannot make it reserve memory.
