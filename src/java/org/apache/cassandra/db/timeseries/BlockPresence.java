/**
 * The four per-block presence modes of chunk-format-v4 §4 -- {@code ALL_PRESENT}, {@code ALL_NULL},
 * {@code BITMAP}, {@code RLE} -- and the block-local {@code rank} of §2.
 *
 * <p><b>The load-bearing decision is that all four modes decode into the same {@code long[]} bit-word
 * array, once per block.</b> §4 keeps RLE because a sparse column really is smaller as runs (the
 * cross-over is around 84 transitions per 1024 rows), and keeps BITMAP because runs cannot be
 * vectorised or randomly accessed. Expanding both into words at block-open time buys the
 * compression without paying for it on every read: the value-decode loop, the {@code rank} that
 * turns a row offset into a value index, and any future {@code BitPackingVector} kernel
 * ({@code VectorMask.fromLong} takes one word per 64 lanes, §6) all see words and never a varint.
 * A decoder that walked the runs directly would reintroduce exactly the serial dependency v4 spent
 * its budget removing.
 *
 * <p><b>Storage-mode choice is an exact-size argmin, never a heuristic</b> (§5 rule 3). Both zero
 * byte modes win outright when they apply; otherwise the smaller of the two byte counts wins and an
 * exact tie resolves to the smaller mode code, i.e. {@code BITMAP}. Nothing here trial-encodes,
 * samples, or consults a threshold: a replica that resolved a tie differently would produce a
 * byte-different chunk, {@code chunkUnchanged} would report a difference, and every chunk would be
 * rewritten every cycle.
 *
 * <p><b>Mode codes.</b> §4 lists the four modes in the low two bits of {@code blockFlags} but does
 * not number them; this class takes the listing order, which also puts {@code ALL_PRESENT} at 0 so
 * that the overwhelmingly common block -- fully present, no exceptions -- has all-zero flags. Unlike
 * the type codes of §4 there is no zero trap here, because a presence mode is not dispatched on by
 * name and an all-zero {@code blockFlags} byte is a legitimate, expected value.
 *
 * <p><b>Padding and canonical varints are verified, not assumed</b> (§5 rules 4 and 5). The RLE
 * layout is exactly {@code u16 runCount | u8 firstRunPresent | u8 pad | varint runLengths[]} padded
 * to 8; the pad byte, the trailing padding, the {@code firstRunPresent} byte being strictly 0 or 1,
 * the minimal length of every varint, runs of at least one row and runs summing to exactly
 * {@code blockRows} are all checked on decode. The bitmap's bits at positions {@code >= blockRows}
 * must be zero (§5 rule 6) and that too is verified: a non-zero trailing bit breaks {@code rank} --
 * silently, by returning another row's value rather than throwing -- and breaks byte determinism,
 * because the same presence pattern would then have more than one encoding.
 *
 * <p>Corruption surfaces as {@link IllegalArgumentException}, and every allocation here is sized
 * from {@code blockRows}, which the caller derives from the header, never from a length read out of
 * the payload. A corrupt block therefore cannot make this class reserve memory.

     * O(words touched), not O(rows).
     *
     * <p>This is the whole point of the class javadoc's argument, and it was originally written the
     * other way round. The claim above is that expanding RLE into bit words at block-open time is
     * what removes the serial per-row dependency the format spent its budget on -- but a per-row
     * {@code words[i >>> 6] |= 1L << (i & 63)} loop *is* that serial dependency, just moved. It
     * repeatedly read-modify-writes the same word: a 1024-row block that is one long present run
     * cost 1024 dependent iterations to set 16 words. The expansion has to be word-at-a-time or it
     * reintroduces exactly what it was meant to remove.
     *
     * <p>The two partial words are where this can go wrong, and nowhere else. {@code -1L << (from &
     * 63)} keeps bits {@code from..63}; {@code -1L >>> (-to & 63)} keeps bits {@code 0..(to-1)&63}
     * and is deliberately written against {@code -to} so that a word-aligned {@code to} yields a
     * shift of 0 and a full mask rather than an empty one. A run confined to one word takes the
     * intersection of both masks. An off-by-one at either edge does not throw -- it shifts one
     * column's values by one row -- so the test for it is a differential property against a naive
     * per-row reference, over runs placed at every alignment.
