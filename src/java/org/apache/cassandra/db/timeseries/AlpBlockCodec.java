 *                [exception area, W = 2]        -- left parts that missed the dictionary
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>What was already true, and what this class had to add</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link AlpCodec} already owned everything that is hard to get right about ALP and nothing that
 * is specific to a container. It guarantees, and this class inherits without restating: the
 * {@code (e, f)} search with its fixed integer stride and its specified (score asc, {@code e} asc,
 * {@code f} asc) tie-break; the exact power-of-ten tables, which are decimal literals and never
 * {@code Math.pow}; the acceptance test being {@code doubleToRawLongBits(decode(encode(v))) == raw}
 * rather than {@code ==} on doubles, which is what refuses {@code -0.0} and every NaN into the
 * exception path instead of canonicalising them; the ALP-RD dictionary chosen by an array scan under
 * (frequency desc, value asc) and never by hash iteration; and {@code strictfp} arithmetic whose
 * only floating-point operations are multiplication and {@link Math#rint}.
 *
 * <p>What it did <b>not</b> have is anything about the v4 block: it was written against the v3
 * container, and its own framing is a sub-format byte, LEB128 varints, gap-coded exception positions
 * and an MSB-first {@code BitWriter} bitstream with no alignment.
 *
 * <h2>The framing decision: reuse the planning, re-frame the bytes</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>{@link AlpCodec}'s framing is not reusable inside a v4 block and is not kept whole.</b> Four
 * of its five framing choices are things v4 removed on purpose:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Its bitstream is {@link BitWriter}, which is <b>MSB-first</b>. §6 makes v4 lanes LSB-first and
 *     {@link BitPacking}'s javadoc states that the two conventions must never meet -- they agree at
 *     width 8 and silently disagree everywhere else.</li>
 * <li>Its exception list is a private gap-coded varint list. §5 gives v4 one exception mechanism,
 *     the shared {@link ExceptionArea}, and the whole argument for making it shared is that a
 *     per-codec one buys nothing for the integer columns and the timestamp axis.</li>
 * <li>Its sub-format byte re-states, inside the body, what {@code blockEncoding} already says in the
 *     block table. Two spellings of one fact is a second byte form.</li>
 * <li>It pads to nothing. §6 requires every block body to be a multiple of 8 with verified zero
 *     padding, which is the format's cheapest tripwire for a reused scratch buffer.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>So the bytes are v4's. <b>The planning is {@link AlpCodec}'s, by call and not by copy</b>, which
 * is the half of the decision that matters: {@link AlpCodec#exponentCandidates} is the only
 * {@code (e, f)} search in the build and {@link AlpCodec#selectRdDictionary} is the only ALP-RD
 * dictionary in the build. A second copy of either is how two replicas start disagreeing about which
 * exponent pair or which eight left parts a block uses -- a byte difference, which
 * {@code chunkUnchanged} reports forever, which rewrites every chunk every cycle and presents as a
 * capacity problem rather than as a codec bug (§12). What this class adds around them is the exact
 * v4 cost of a candidate, which is a different function from the v3 cost and has to be, because the
 * bytes are different.
 *
 * <h2>Exact sizes, never a trial encode</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #payloadLength} is a closed form over a completed plan: header, plus
 * {@link BitPacking#packedLength}, plus {@link ExceptionArea#encodedLength}. Nothing is encoded to
 * find out how long it is (§5 rule 3), which matters because {@link BlockEncodings#chooseFixed}
 * calls it before any byte exists and lays out the following blocks' {@code bodyOffset}s from the
 * number it returns. {@link #encode} re-plans through the same pure function and asserts it wrote
 * exactly that many bytes.
 *
 * <p><b>The variant choice is not made here.</b> {@link BlockEncodings#chooseFixed} scores
 * {@code 0x20} then {@code 0x21} and displaces the incumbent only on a strictly smaller size, so an
 * exact tie goes to {@code 0x20 ALP} -- the same rule {@link AlpCodec#choose} applies for v3, arrived
 * at by the same lowest-code-wins argmin every other v4 encoding is chosen by.
 *
 * <h2>Two details that look like waste and are not</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>The lane has a slot for every value, including exceptions</b>, holding §5 rule 6's specified
 * filler {@code 0} there. {@link AlpCodec} skipped exception slots in its bitstream. v4 cannot: an
 * {@link ExceptionArea} position is by definition an index into the lane it accompanies, and
 * {@link ExceptionArea#checkLaneIsZeroAtExceptions} -- the check that gives a dead slot exactly one
 * byte form -- has nothing to check if the slot is absent. The cost is {@code exceptions * width}
 * bits, which is what {@code FOR_BITPACK} pays for the same guarantee.
 *
 * <p><b>The ALP-RD dictionary is written in ascending value order, not in code order.</b>
 * {@link AlpCodec#selectRdDictionary} returns it most-frequent-first because that is v3's code
 * assignment; here the entries are sorted and the code is the index in that order. It costs nothing
 * -- every code is {@code codeBits} wide whatever the order -- and it buys §5 rule 2's ascending,
 * duplicate-free dictionary, so the decoder rejects a duplicated entry (which would give one left
 * part two codes, and one block two byte forms) with the same comparison that checks the order.
 *
 * <h2>Installation is a build-time constant</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #INSTANCE} is the only way to obtain this codec and there is no switch, no property and
 * no {@code cassandra.yaml} key that turns it off. That is deliberate and it is the single largest
 * risk in the format (§12): a codec present on some replicas and absent on others makes identical
 * input produce different bytes, and the failure does not look like a codec bug. A node either runs
 * a build that has {@code 0x20}/{@code 0x21} or runs a build that does not, and §9's version byte is
 * what distinguishes those.
 *
 * <p>Corruption is {@link IllegalArgumentException} (§11): every field read out of the payload is
 * range-checked before it is used, every pad byte is verified zero, the sub-lengths are required to
 * add up to the {@code payloadLength} the block table derived, and nothing allocates against a
 * number taken from the bytes.
