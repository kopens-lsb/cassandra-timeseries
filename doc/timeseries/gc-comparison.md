# GC comparison: Generational ZGC vs G1

Same node, same data set (100,000,000 rows in 1,000 partitions), same queries; each side ran a warm-up pass first and the numbers below are the second, warm pass.

## Write throughput

| GC | rows | seconds | rows/s |
|---|---|---|---|
| Generational ZGC | 10,000,000 | 34 | **296,636** |
| G1 | 10,000,000 | 35 | **287,793** |

G1 is -3.0% on write throughput relative to Generational ZGC.

## GC activity (whole run, from -Xlog:gc)

| GC | kind | count | total | avg | p99 | max |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Generational ZGC | collection cycles (concurrent) | 75 | 290960.0 ms | 3879.467 ms | 18668.000 ms | **18668.000 ms** |
| G1 | stop-the-world pauses | 31 | 1477.5 ms | 47.660 ms | 459.059 ms | **459.059 ms** |

G1 logs stop-the-world pauses at this log level; ZGC logs whole collection cycles that run concurrently with the application, so its cycle durations are *not* pause times.

| single partition (100000 rows) | approx_count_distinct | 280 ms | 333 ms | +18.9% |
| single partition (100000 rows) | integral + time_weighted_average | 287 ms | 346 ms | +20.8% |
| gap-fill | gapfill 1h + locf over the full span | 376 ms | 431 ms | +14.7% |
| gap-fill | gapfill 5m + interpolate over 6h | 91 ms | 99 ms | +8.9% |
| multi-partition | 10 series, hourly avg (1000000 rows) | 3,362 ms | 4,268 ms | +27.0% |
| multi-partition | 100 series, hourly avg (10000000 rows) | 33,333 ms | 44,303 ms | +32.9% |
| multi-partition | 100 series, p95 per series | 28,785 ms | 35,878 ms | +24.6% |
| dashboard query | OHLC + change + p95 per hour | 437 ms | 657 ms | +50.2% |
| full table scan (100000000 rows) | count(*) over the whole table | 205,983 ms | 261,894 ms | +27.1% |
| | **total** | **275,404 ms** | **351,370 ms** | **+27.6%** |

A negative difference means G1 was faster.

## Method and caveats

- Single node in a container, 16G heap, identical `cassandra.yaml` (only the request
  timeouts are raised so multi-million-row aggregates can finish). The G1 side enables the
  tuning block that ships commented out in `conf/jvm21-server.options` and restores
  compressed oops, which the shipped ZGC block disables as a jamm workaround.
- One measured pass per collector after one warm-up pass. Repeated passes of the same
  query on the same collector varied by roughly 10%, so treat single-query differences
  below that as noise; the direction is consistent across every query here.
- ZGC pause times are not in this report: at `-Xlog:gc` the ZGC lines are concurrent cycle
  durations, not stop-the-world time. Re-run both sides with `-Xlog:gc*,safepoint` (which
  `docker/scale-test.sh` now sets) to compare real pauses.
